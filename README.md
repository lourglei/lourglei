# 👋 Hi, I’m @lourglei

- 👀 I’m interested in software development, database optimization, and building efficient applications with .NET and Angular. I also enjoy exploring how technology can modernize business processes, especially in financial services.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning English and improving my skills in .NET 6 and SQL performance tuning. Additionally, I'm diving into recursive queries and optimizing large data processes for better efficiency.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving backend systems, database management, and performance improvements—especially those that challenge me to work with large datasets or intricate APIs.  
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I recently started swimming lessons because I couldn’t dive into the ocean on a trip—now I'm hooked!
